This is my first attempt at an actors library developed for the Yeti language.
The project uses maven (with yeti plugin) for build and tests.
It also has a dependencz on my other yeti project: yeti-tests.

Examples will follow later.

The library will provide just a few simple APIs to make it
simple and straightforward to work with.
